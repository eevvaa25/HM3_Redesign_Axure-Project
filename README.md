## 🎯 Research Question
**How can the HeartMate 3 LVAD controller be redesigned using a human-centered approach to reduce alarm-related anxiety, improve usability, and enhance safety for patients, caregivers, and clinicians?**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Axure RP (Interactive Prototyping)

## 🔍 Key Findings 
- Patients rely heavily on guidebooks, increasing cognitive load
- Remote monitoring and structured dashboards improve perceived control and clarity
- Alarm ambiguity and limited differentiation significantly increase patient anxiety
- Small, low-resolution screens impair rapid comprehension during high-stress events
- Checklist-style troubleshooting supports error prevention and psychological reassurance
- Reviewers scored the mobile application >8/10 across usability domains

## 💡 Interpretation
- The major challenges of the HeartMate 3 system are cognitive and usability-driven
- By making alerts clearer, organizing information better, using plain language, and adding remote monitoring can reduce patient stress and help them respond more confidently

## 🚀 Actionable Insight 
- A redesigned system incorporating these factors can reduce cognitive burden, improve alarm interpretation, and strengthen patient-centered LVAD management
  - Larger high-resolution touchscreen controller
  - Color-coded severity alerts (Emergency / Hazard / Informational)
  - Step-by-step plain language troubleshooting
  - Companion mobile application with real-time pump trend visualization
  - Encrypted remote log transmission
  - Automated emergency escalation protocols

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Low fidelity prototype
- Small heuristic evaluation sample (n=3)
- Limited real-time interaction testing
- No live patient deployment
